        <p> Johnny Bright was a great American athlete. He set professional football records that still stand. Yet today few Americans even know his name, much less his story.
        
        If only as an act of contrition, it is important that they do.
        
        Nearly 50 years after the incident that changed his life forever, it is almost as though America made a conscious effort to forget it ever happened, and in the process forgot about him, too.
        
        Johnny Bright might very well have become the first black Heisman Trophy winner, until a brutal, unsportsmanlike act of racism cost him whatever chance he had. He was a first-round NFL draft choice, but he had already experienced first-hand the physical, racially-directed violence that Jackie Robinson, for all his courage, had only been threatened with. Unsure of his safety on the playing fields of his own country, he left it for Canada, the first NFL first-round draft choice ever to do so. And instead of becoming one of the best players the NFL has ever seen, he became one of the best players in the history of Canadian football, and a valued and respected member of his community when his playing days were over.
        
        At Central High School in his native Fort Wayne, Indiana, Johnny led the football team to a city title in 1945, and as a 5-foot-10, 180-pounder who could jump high enough to touch the rim with his elbow, led the basketball team to a pair of appearances in Indiana's prestigious Final Four. He often won as many as five events in a single track meet. And he was an outstanding boxer.
        
        Yet for all his accomplishments, no home state school recruited him. Purdue never showed any interest, Notre Dame didn't recruit blacks at the time, and according to his high school coach, Indiana's coach said he "already had enough black running backs."
        
        So Johnny settled instead for a track scholarship to Drake University, in Des Moines, Iowa, on the condition that he could also try out for the basketball and football teams. After sitting out his freshman year because of the freshman-ineligibility rules of those times, he made the football team as a sophomore, and it became immediately apparent to the coaches at Drake, then struggling to play big-time football, that they had something special in Johnny Bright. As the tailback in Drake's single wing attack, he ran for 975 yards and threw for another 975 in nine games to lead the nation in total offense, and the Bulldogs to a 6-2-1 season in 1949. He also lettered as a sophomore in basketball and track, but decided after that year to concentrate on

         <p>Johnny Bright was a extradionary college football player and Canadian Football League.
         He was recruited heavily by the Michigan State University football team and initially accepted a scholarship to the school but changed his mind.
         Sophomore year he participated in the pole vault where he had a personal best of 13 feet and in the long jump where he set a personal best of 6 feet, 2 inches.
         The time that Johnny entered college, freshman athletes were ineligible to play during their first year in order to give them time to devote to their studies. Thus, Johnny did not suit up for the Drake football team until 1949.
         Wooden said “Coach Whitworth built up this story that Bright was kind of a prima donna type… When he didn’t carry the ball, he didn’t move out of his tracks. He just stood there. We considered that not being a team player.” Smith’s explanation was that he had previously tackled Bright out of bounds with a clean, legal hit the prior year. “I got up, and was actually going to help him get up, and Bright just laid there. And here come the people with the trolley, with the stretcher to carry him out. </p>
